function to insert, print is used.

# Final.java
It inserts binary file called "share.dat" to the linkedlist. During insertion, the data will be automanitcally sort. There is some interactive process where user can choose to load - add - delete - save or exit. 
Load will load the current binary file and print out the list in sorted order
Add will ask user to enter a name to add and insert it to the linked list.
Delete will delete the name from the linked list if the name exist in the linkedlist.
Save will save the current addition to the current binary file
Exit will take exit the program.
